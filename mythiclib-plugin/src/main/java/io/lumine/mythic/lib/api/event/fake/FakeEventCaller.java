/**
 * Some plugins call "fake" Bukkit events to check for specific
 * restrictions. The event cancellation state gives the value
 * of such restriction. The most common type of fake events are
 * - damage events for fighting restrictions
 * - block break/place events for building/mining restrictions
 * <p>
 * The concept of fake events is much more compatible AND
 * resilient than natively implementing specific checks as long
 * as plugins that do fire fake events are handled.
 * <p>
 * Fake events are used very commonly in MythicLib and other plugins.
 * For instance, to check if a player is able to fight with/target
 * another entity/player before casting the damage method.
 * <p>
 * Here are some of the plugins that use fake events:
 * - MMO plugins (MythicLib)
 * - mcMMO
 * - Fabled
 * - Any plugin that uses 0 as damage for fake damage events
 *
 * @param <E> Class of event fired
