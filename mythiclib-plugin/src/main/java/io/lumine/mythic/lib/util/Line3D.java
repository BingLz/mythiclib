     * Using the quadratic formula to project a point
     * onto an axis and then taking the vector length
     * to calculate the distance from this point to the axis.
     * <p>
     * Let (e, f, g) be the point off the axis of which we
     * are calculating the distance from the axis
     * <p>
     * The parametric equation of the line is the following:
     * point = someAxisPoint + t * vector
     * (x, y, z) = (a, b, c) + t * (alpha, beta, gamma)
     * <p>
     * The "distance" vector is:
     * (a + t * alpha - e, b + t * beta - f, c + t * gamma - g)
     * <p>
     * The length of that vector is a second degree polynomial
     * of the variable t. We're looking for its global minimum
     * and the general value for the extrema is given by the
     * canonical formula: - b / (2 * a)
     * <p>
     * This is the value of t for which the distance is the smallest.
     * Then calculate the corresponding point and calculate its
     * distance from the initial point.
